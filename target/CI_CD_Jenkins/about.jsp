		<h1>Wel come to CI/CD with jenkins Testing</h1>
		<h2>Here is the information about CI/CD</h2>
		<p>Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) is a
			set of practices aimed at automating the software development
			lifecycle, enhancing code quality, and streamlining deployment.
			Jenkins, an open-source automation server, is one of the most popular
			tools for implementing CI/CD pipelines, making it easy to integrate,
			test, and deploy code changes efficiently. In a Jenkins-powered CI/CD
			pipeline, developers push code changes to a shared repository, which
			triggers a Jenkins job. Jenkins can then build the application, run
			automated tests, and notify developers of any issues in real time.
			This rapid feedback loop encourages developers to commit small,
			frequent changes, catching bugs early and making the development
			process more manageable. Once the code passes the testing phase,
			Jenkins can move to the Continuous Deployment (CD) phase, where code
			is automatically deployed to staging or production environments.
			Jenkins supports integration with various cloud providers like AWS
			and Azure, allowing for deployment across multiple platforms.
			Additionally, Jenkins plugins enable configuration management and
			orchestration with tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and Ansible,
			providing a comprehensive CI/CD solution. Jenkins can also handle
			multiple build stages, such as code compilation, packaging, static
			code analysis, and security checks, using plugins and declarative
			pipeline scripts. These pipelines provide visibility into each step,
			helping teams identify bottlenecks and ensure the delivery process
			remains smooth. Overall, Jenkins plays a crucial role in CI/CD by
			reducing manual efforts, enhancing code quality, and accelerating
			delivery cycles, supporting Agile development methodologies and
			ensuring quicker time-to-market for applications.</p>
